The type of project
We would like to prepare a business plan for a small Green Business social enterprise. The business we propose DIY mini plantation complemented by a workshop. We chose this business as it enriches the quality of life for mothers while organic planting simultaneously protects and enhances the ecological environment.
Outline of the project
According to a survey on "Middle-Class Family Parent-Child Interaction Communication Status," 38.4% of middle-class parents spend less than two hours with their children after work. Respondents feel resigned, with some opting for takeout to save time. Therefore, our activities provide the opportunity for them to bond. Our target market is price-insensitive working mothers. Our course price is $500 for adults and $300 for children.
We plan to design a DIY mini greenhouse plantation using renewable resources and materials to support eco-friendly activities for diverse plant growth. Our activities allow mothers and children to participate together to enhance parent-child relationships. They can harvest crops and use solar energy principles to cook food. Besides, we also employ disabled people as our employees so they can earn extra income through simple jobs to reduce their living burden. Their job is to be responsible for the daily management of the plants. Regular training sessions will be provided to improve their gardening skills and promote knowledge sharing.
With an initial capital of HKD 1.5 million, we will rent land in Yuen Long, featuring greenhouses and kitchen. Customers may sign up for workshops through social media. Our Instagram platform will instant updates to foster community engagement. Participants are encouraged to bring their own kitchen seeds for cultivation. Successful growers will receive discounted rates for future sessions, incentivizing sustainable practices. As business expands, we will include online gardening courses to teach cultivation techniques.
Problems and solutions
Our event may lead to harmful gases. The greenhouse has poor ventilation and high temperatures. Plant food is easily releasing harmful gases like ammonia and carbon monoxide, affecting plant growth and polluting the air. Thus, we will use organic soil and plant food to improve the release of harmful gases. Furthermore, our public awareness is low because we are a new company, so we were less competitive in the industry. Therefore, we frequently advertise on Instagram with eye-catching content to increase our visibility and enhance our competitiveness in the early stage of our business.

The development process relies on software development kits (SDKs) such as Samsung’s IoT SDK or Tizen Studio, which allow engineers to create and test trigger logic and application updates. A database management tool (such as MySQL or a NoSQL system hosted in the SmartThings cloud) is needed to organize and query the large amount of feedback data collected. Security is paramount, requiring encryption protocols (such as AES-256) and authentication frameworks to protect user information in transit and in storage. For personalization features, such as recommending movies on a smart TV or promoting faster washing machines, machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow Lite or Samsung’s proprietary AI tools are needed to train user behavior models. These applications ensure that the system is not only fully functional, but also secure, efficient, and able to provide a customized experience. 縮短

At the core of this system are sensors tailored to each device’s functionality. For smart refrigerators, built-in scanners such as cameras or RFID readers are essential to detect ingredients and monitor door-opening frequency, enabling the system to trigger questions like “Is the storage space enough?” Smart TVs require motion sensors or usage trackers to monitor viewing times, app usage, and content categories, ensuring surveys like “Are you satisfied with the picture quality?” appear at the right moment. AI washing machines depend on weight and fabric sensors to assess load characteristics and track function usage, while air conditioners rely on temperature and humidity sensors to measure environmental conditions and runtime. Across all devices, additional sensors like proximity detectors or touch inputs may enhance event detection and user interaction. These sensors feed data into embedded microcontrollers or processors—such as Samsung’s Exynos chips—which must possess sufficient computational power to run lightweight AI algorithms for real-time event detection and survey generation. Connectivity is another critical hardware requirement, with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth modules ensuring a stable link to the SmartThings cloud for data uploads and updates. Finally, user interfaces like OLED/AMOLED displays, microphones, speakers for Bixby integration, and touchscreens or buttons provide the means for delivering surveys and capturing responses.

supermarkets will lay off cashiers, whose roles will be replaced by self-checkout machines, new job opportunities will be
created in other sectors. Firstly, in the retail sector, supermarkets will need to hire staff to assist customers in using the
self-checkout machines. These staff members can help customers with tasks such as scanning product barcodes or printing
receipts for their purchases. Furthermore, if customers leave trolleys or baskets near the self-checkout machines, these
employees can return them to the supermarket’s entrance for other shoppers to use. Secondly, in the innovation and
technology sector, companies that supply self-checkout machines to supermarkets will need to provide after-sale services.
These companies will regularly send technicians to inspect the machines and ensure they are functioning properly. If the
machines malfunction, technicians will be dispatched to repair them promptly. Moreover, companies in this sector will
employ product designers to develop new models of self-checkout machines. For example, these designers may create a
more user-friendly touchscreen interface or produce a more sensitive scanner. Therefore, the unemployment rate in Hong
Kong is unlikely to rise significantly due to the layoffs of cashiers. Instead, new career opportunities will emerge in roles
such as customer-service personnel, technicians, and product designers.解釋

Techniques requirement: Segment the email list based on customer purchase history, regular update of email database to remove inactive or invalid email addresses.
•       Customer feedback survey requirement: Online survey platforms, customer database, feedback management team.
Techniques: design targeted surveys to maximize response rate, distributing surveys through multiple channels, regular update survey questions

•       Customer feedback survey: Required survey tool and feedback team to review the responses weekly and update new questions. Low engagement if the survey is too long and time is costing.
•       Telemarketing: Low engagement as customers dislikes hot calls. Repeating scripts and response might cause workers to burn out and poor performance
•       Print advertising: Hard to measure as no direct tracking. Location might be limited by posters restrictions. However, if the design is eye-catching, it grabs attention from customers.
